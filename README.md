# Game-with-pygame
This repository represents a game I created during college using the Pygame library.

This is a game designed to help learn the use of the Pygame library. The game involves shooting a ball from a cannon, adjusting the force and direction, to bounce off a wall and hit a hole on the opposite side. To play the game, simply download all the files and run the fire_in_a_hole.py file in Visual Studio Code.
